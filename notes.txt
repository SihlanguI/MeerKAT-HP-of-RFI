needs a requirements.txt file or a pip install option which you then mention in the readme

organise your files into different directories for different types of files (ie source files together (can have sub-folders/modules, config files together, etc.
make use of __init__.py file to setup, initialise and load config.
break off code into smaller functions.
references should be reletive to location in the project so that the source is self contained- try avoid commiting items referencing things outside the source and its dependencies
